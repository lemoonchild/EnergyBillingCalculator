This application is designed to efficiently calculate and analyze energy billing based on various consumer usage data and tariff rates. Proudly developed by **Nahomy Castro** and **Xavier López**, dedicated students from Universidad del Valle de Guatemala.

## Overview

The Energy Billing Calculator provides an intuitive interface where users can input specific energy usage details, including time of use, amount of energy consumed, and applicable rates. The application processes this information to present a detailed breakdown of the expected billing amount, enabling users to understand and manage their energy expenses effectively.

## Emphasis on Accuracy

In the realm of energy billing, accuracy is paramount to ensure fair and correct billing practices. While there may be slight variations due to rounding or specific tariff conditions, our application is engineered to provide results that are as close to the actual billing amount as possible. Advanced algorithms and careful data handling ensure that the calculations reflect precise consumer usage and current tariff rates.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for easy input of energy consumption details and tariff rates.
- Detailed breakdown of energy bills, including different usage categories and corresponding charges.
- Capability to handle varying tariff structures and billing cycles.
- Utilizes robust computation methods to ensure accurate and reliable results.
